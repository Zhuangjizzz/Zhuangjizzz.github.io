## 🌐 EDA Open Innovation Cooperation Mechanism Introduction

The EDA Open Innovation Cooperation Mechanism (EDA Ecosystem Development Accelerator, abbreviated as EDA²) is a cooperation mechanism voluntarily composed of enterprises, universities, research institutes, and professional institutions engaged in integrated circuit electronic design automation research, design, verification, testing, application, services, and upstream and downstream industries. It is established under the common vision of achieving diversified supply of integrated circuit electronic design automation and building long-term competitiveness, focusing on promoting the development of the integrated circuit electronic design automation industry. EDA² is based on a global perspective, with the purpose of optimizing the industrial chain, serving the industry, promoting innovation, facilitating applications, and strengthening collaboration. Through integrating industrial resources such as technology and talent, it strives to build an advanced and comprehensive industry research, industry-academia-research connection, forward-looking research, standard development, testing and certification, open source development, and talent cultivation ecosystem development platform for integrated circuit electronic design automation, fully leveraging the advantages of all parties to achieve win-win progress.

## 🏛️ School and Laboratory Introduction

The School of Integrated Circuits and Micro-nano Electronics traces its origins to the semiconductor physics program established by Academician Xie Xide at Fudan University in 1958. It serves as a flagship force for the university's proactive response to national strategic needs and vigorous promotion of new engineering construction. As the national team for talent cultivation and research breakthrough in the field of integrated circuits, the school takes cultivating talents with disruptive innovation capabilities and industry transformation abilities as its fundamental mission. It concentrates Fudan University's most advantageous teaching and research faculty, leveraging the unique resource advantage among national universities of gathering national-level key research platforms and full industrial chain layout in integrated circuits to provide students with "interchange bridge" training program design and build a first-class talent cultivation highland.

The National Key Laboratory of Integrated Chips and Systems at Fudan University is one of the 20 reorganized "benchmark" laboratories. In 2022, based on the former National Key Laboratory of Application Specific Integrated Circuit and System, it was approved by the Ministry of Science and Technology to be reorganized and established at Fudan University. The laboratory has established 5 innovation centers: Integrated Chips, EDA, IP/Architecture, Ultra-High-Speed Circuits and Systems, and Future Chips, dedicated to promoting the development of China's integrated circuit industry.
